Title,Summary
Introduction to genomics.,"The science ofgenomes: only within the past few decades have scientists progressed from the analysis of a single or a small number of genes at once to the investigation of thousands of genes, going from the study of the units of inheritance to the investigation of the who …"
Pan-genomicsin the humangenomeera.,"As sequencing costs have dropped, thousands of newgenomeshave been sequenced, and scientists have come to realize that a single referencegenomeis inadequate for many purposes. ...As scientists continue to survey and catalogue thegenomicvariation across …"
ComparativeGenomicsfor Prokaryotes.,"Bacteria and archaea, collectively known as prokaryotes, have in generalgenomesthat are much smaller than those of eukaryotes. As a result, thousands of thesegenomeshave been sequenced. ...These two facts mean that there is an abundance of data for prokaryotic …"
"Plant pan-genomics: recent advances, new challenges, and roads ahead.","In this review, we summarize the definition and recent achievements of plant pan-genomics, computational technologies used for pan-genomeconstruction, and the applications of pan-genomesin plantgenomicsand molecular breeding. We also discuss challe …"
"Computational pan-genomics: status, promises and challenges.","Many disciplines, from human genetics and oncology to plant breeding, microbiology and virology, commonly face the challenge of analyzing rapidly increasing numbers ofgenomes. In case of Homo sapiens, the number of sequencedgenomeswill approach hundreds of thousa …"
Insect MitochondrialGenomics: A Decade of Progress.,"The past decade has seen the availability of insectgenomicdata explode, with mitochondrial (mt)genomedata seeing the greatest growth. The widespread adoption of next-generation sequencing has solved many earlier methodological limitations, allowing the routine s …"
Genomicsas the key to unlocking the polyploid potential of wheat.,"Until recently, the high sequence conservation between homoeologous genes, together with the largegenomesize of polyploid wheat, had hinderedgenomicanalyses in this important crop species. In the past 5 yr, however, the advent of next-generation sequencing has r …"
Howgenomicshas affected the concept of microbiology.,"The concept of the 'universal' minimalgenomeis being challenged, and the ability of minimalgenomesto support cellular complexity is under investigation. ...Lastly, the taxonomic potential ofgenomicsis emerging, as studies of multiple strains allow us to …"
Microbialgenomeanalysis: the COG approach.,"For the past 20 years, the Clusters of Orthologous Genes (COG) database had been a popular tool for microbialgenomeannotation and comparativegenomics. Initially created for the purpose of evolutionary classification of protein families, the COG have been used, ap …"
A roadmap to increase diversity ingenomicstudies.,"Two decades ago, the sequence of the first humangenomewas published. Since then, advances ingenometechnologies have resulted in whole-genomesequencing and microarray-based genotyping of millions of humangenomes. ...Our Perspective highlights the …"
